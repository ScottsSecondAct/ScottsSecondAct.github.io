I'm a computer and software engineer who has always dreamed of teaching.  After a career in industry, I've transitioned to teaching and research.  I could not be happier.

### More Information

#### Where I Teach

* Sierra College in Rocklin, CA
* California State University, Sacramento

#### Classes that I Teach

* Introduction to Computer Science.
* Introduction to Programming Logic.
* Programming Concepts and Methodology.
* Introduction to Computer Architecture.

#### Research Interests

* **Edge AI**
  * Next-Generation Healthcare Devices: Research on real-time disease monitoring and management tools, such as artificial pancreas systems that autonomously regulate insulin levels and advanced wearable devices that provide continuous health insights.
  * Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Explore devices that link the human brain with edge-based AI hardware/software to treat neurological conditions and restore lost motor function (e.g., stroke rehabilitation), offering more responsive and personalized care.
  * Ultra-low-cost point-of-care (POC) devices: Explore devices that require minimal infrastructure and little or no electricity to enable Community Health Care Workers (CHCW) to diagnose diseases quickly in rural, resource-limited regions of the world.
  * Autonomous Vehicles: Combine AI and Peer-to-Peer networking technologies to avoid collisions or near collisions.  Similar to the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) used in aviation.
* **Deep Learning**
  * Computer Vision: Investigation of state-of-the-art visual recognition and interpretation techniques, particularly for applications like medical imaging diagnostics, automated anomaly detection, and advanced object recognition.
  * Healthcare Applications: Develop deep learning models for predictive analytics, personalized treatment planning, early disease detection, and optimizing patient outcomes.
* **AI Modeling of Complex Biological Processes**
  * Autoimmune Response Modeling: Creation of sophisticated computational frameworks to simulate, analyze, and predict autoimmune reactions, contributing to the design of novel diagnostic tools, targeted therapies, and precision medicine approaches.
* **Complexity and Chaos Theory**
  * Explore how non-linear dynamics, emergent behaviors, and feedback loops shape complex systems.
  * Apply these concepts to model and predict human, biological, and environmental phenomena.
